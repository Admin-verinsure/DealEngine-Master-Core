	<p>A <b>document</b> is a written, drawn, presented or recorded representation of thoughts. Originating from the Latin <i>Documentum</i> meaning lesson - the verb doceo means to teach, and is pronounced similarly, in the past it was usually used as a term for a written proof used as evidence. In the <a href="/wiki/Computer_age" title="Computer age" class="mw-redirect">computer age</a>, a document is usually used to describe a primarily textual <a href="/wiki/Computer_file" title="Computer file">file</a>, along with its structure and design, such as fonts, colors and additional <a href="/wiki/Computer_image" title="Computer image" class="mw-redirect">images</a>.</p>
	<p>The modern term 'document' can no longer be defined by its <a href="/wiki/Transmission_medium" title="Transmission medium">transmission medium</a> (such as paper), following the existence of <a href="/wiki/Electronic_document" title="Electronic document">electronic documents</a>. 'Documentation' has more meanings than a written or drawn presentation of thoughts.</p>
	<p>The formal term 'document' is defined in <a href="/wiki/Library_and_information_science" title="Library and information science">Library and information science</a> and in <a href="/wiki/Documentation_science" title="Documentation science">documentation science</a>, as a basic theoretical construct. It is everything which may be preserved or represented in order to serve as evidence for some purpose. The classical example provided by <a href="/wiki/Suzanne_Briet" title="Suzanne Briet">Suzanne Briet</a> is an <a href="/wiki/Antelope" title="Antelope">antelope</a>: "An antelope running wild on the plains of Africa should not be considered a document, she rules. But if it were to be captured, taken to a zoo and made an object of study, it has been made into a document. It has become physical evidence being used by those who study it. Indeed, scholarly articles written about the antelope are secondary documents, since the antelope itself is the primary document." (Quoted from Buckland, 1998 <sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>). (This view has been seen as an early expression of what now is known as <a href="/wiki/Actor%E2%80%93network_theory" title="Actor–network theory">actor–network theory</a>).</p>

The shift to digital technology would seem to make this distinction even more important. <a href="/wiki/David_M_Levy" title="David M Levy" class="mw-redirect">Levy</a>’s thoughtful analyses have shown that an emphasis on the technology of digital documents has impeded our understanding of digital documents as documents (e.g., Levy, 1994<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>). A conventional document, such as a mail message or a technical report, exists physically in digital technology as a string of bits, as does everything else in a digital environment.
